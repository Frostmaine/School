1. helloA   17144 bytes
   helloA.o 3512  bytes
   helloA.c 222   bytes

2. helloB.c is 255 bytes, which is slightly larger than helloA.c

3. helloB.o is 3512 bytes, this is the same size as helloA.o 

4. helloB is again 17144 bytes. It is identical in size to helloA.

5. The macro does not affect the size of the executable.  I imagine the
   compiler is smart enough to recognize both programs as simple output statements
   and converts them to the same code.


6. hellC.c is 254 bytes, it is almost the same size as helloB.c but still larger
   than helloA.c

7. helloC.o is 3744 bytes, which is significantly larger than either of the
   prior .o files.

8. helloB and helloA are the same size, while helloC is a few hundred bytes larger.

9. Using an array of characters clearly makes the executable larger.
