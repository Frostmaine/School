1. 167

2. -89

3. 39

4. 2B

5. 11111111011001001110011100000011

6. has 32 general purpose 64 bit registers, one of which is the zero register.

8. r0-r7 are used for inputs and outputs

7. x16 and w16 share the same address but hold different amounts of data. The x register holds 64 bits, but the w register holds 32 bits. 

9. bl is the branch with link function. It copies the address of the next instruciton into lr the link register causing a branch with label.

   RET is similar in that it branches to an addressed register, but is hinted to be a return command.

10. a. it is the subtraction command x0 recieves the result of x1 - x0
    b. only the lines that have an ldr command or a store command
    c. they are both branch statements which give functional flow control to the program
    d. movz x0, #01
       movz x8, #0x40
       svc #0

       essentially lines 39-40 and 32-34
       
    e. they compare the value of w2 to zero in a similar vain as the standard strcmp in C language.
       if w2 is not equals to zero then it continues to loop the strlen_loop in both cases.

    f. first sp's address has 48 deducted from it after that sp-48 is stored in x29
       and x30 is stored in the folowing block.  The regegister is essentially pre indexed .
