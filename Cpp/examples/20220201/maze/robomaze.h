// robomaze.h
//    declaration for a robot class that can
//    be steered through a maze
// pre-condition:
//    a valid maze has been created, and the robot
//    can use the maze to "understand" where it is
// post-condition:
//    root will have found its way to the lower right.
// value semantics:
//    robot can be copied or assigned
#ifndef _ROBOMAZE_ // pre processor to ensure class is not defined twice
